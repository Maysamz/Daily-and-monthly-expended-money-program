# Daily-and-monthly-expended-money-program :credit_card:
Being aware of our spending is the best way of utilizing our money. So,due to the importance
of keeping track of the Inflow and Outflow of our daily and monthly expenses we are
developing an expense tracker application called “Money Flow” using Python programming
language.
<br />”Money Flow” helps people to monitor and categorize their expenses across the different
places.Our app allows users to view their current balance and date and to search and display
their previous transactions by type,category and period.
<br />Also, the users are able to make a new
transaction and specify the source and the type of it.”Money Flow” will help the users to
gain control of their finances so if they are trying to pay with an amount that exceeds their
balances, the transaction would be rejected and and they will be notify with an error message.
